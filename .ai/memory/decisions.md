## ADR-001: Centralized Theme System

**Date:** 2025-02-12

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
The application needed a consistent design language with colors extracted from the logo and background assets (volcanic/infernal aesthetic).

**Decision:**
- Define all design tokens in `globals.css` `@theme` block (single source of truth)
- Use semantic color names (ember, molten, blood, bone, stone, ash) instead of generic Tailwind defaults
- Define custom shadows with high opacity for dark backgrounds
- Apply background image with gradient overlay using CSS multiple backgrounds (no z-index needed)

**Consequences:**
- All design token changes can be made in one place (`globals.css`)
- Consistent visual language across components
- Component `.styles.ts` files use Tailwind classes that reference theme tokens
- No need for a separate JS theme file - everything is CSS-native
